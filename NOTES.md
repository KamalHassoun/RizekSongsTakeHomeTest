The Spotify API was confusing at the beginning as it was not clear if the requirement was to implement a login with Spotify mechanism or to just make the application get the Access Token itself through any means. I have went with creating a developer account and using the client id and secret to call the token api and generate said Access Token. This process looking through the documentation took me around an hour and a half before I made a decision which after that was straight forward and took me around 30 minutes to implement. The Songs Fragment and Single Activity acrhitecture was very simple as well and did not take much time.

For Unit testing I do not have much experience if that field so I had to refresh my memory by relearning it and adding tests with observers and mocking the Spotify API.

For the final view it was also straight forward with the excpetion of trying to add the blur behind the player view. I spent almost 2 hours trying to mimic the blur from the designs as much as possible while also using the dominant colour of the image. I have tried adding a mixture on opacity, Top to bottom, and Bottom left to top right gradient. While this did somewhat create some blurred gradient effect it was not similar to the designs and I was not satisfied with it. I opted to take the background as an image from the designs and added to the background of the player view.
